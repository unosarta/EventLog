# EventLog
This homework is based on the concept of an event log in a Monte Carlo
radiation transport application. In this kind of application, a particle moves
around a system colliding with the atoms in that system, losing energy, and
changing direction. Each of these collisions is an event and it is often
necessary to keep a log of these events.
